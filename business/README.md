The following documentation has been prepared for the Business User/Owner/Executive looking to implement open roles as part of their decentralized estate.
It will describe the steps that need to be followed in order to create a Role Matrix that can be implemented using Open Roles.

## Method 

An example  method to creating a Role Matrix is as follows:
1. Define your business hierarchy i.e. which business roles you have e.g. analyst, manager etc. 
2. Secure a list of operations provided by your dApp from your dApp development team 
3. Define your business processes based on role, activity and dApp operation need 
4. Define map your roles to dApp operations based on your business process definitions 
5. Group the role-operation mappings into lists 
6. Identify and fix any security problems in the lists e.g. a dApp administrator having business manager functions when they shouldn't
7. Hand over the lists to the dApp administrator to implement on Open Roles 
8. Test the dApp functions behave according to the list definitions. 
9. Done. You should now have a working implmentation of Open Roless in your dApp
